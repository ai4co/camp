## 💡 Introduction

### *Q. What's the target problem?*

We solve the *Profiled Vehicle Routing Problem* (**PVRP**), which extends the classic *Vehicle Routing Problem* (**VRP**) by incorporating vehicle-specific profiles that define how different vehicles interact with clients. Our implementation focuses on two variants:

**PVRP with Preferences (PVRP-P)**

- Assigns preference scores to vehicle-client pairs;
- Optimizes both route efficiency and preference satisfaction;
- Uses a balancing parameter to weigh between minimizing travel costs and maximizing preferences.

**PVRP with Zone Constraints (PVRP-ZC)**

- Enforces hard constraints on which vehicles can serve specific clients;
- Models restricted zones or access limitations;
- Implemented using preference scores where prohibited combinations are assigned large negative values.

This makes the problem particularly relevant for real-world applications where vehicles have different characteristics or operational constraints. We show the practical examples of PVRPs as following: [Left] PVRP-P has preference zones for each vehicle profile. [Right] PVRP-ZC has zone constraints for certain vehicles.

### *Q. How do we solve the problem?*

We proposed *Collaborative Attention Model with Profiles* (**CAMP**), which is a multi-agent reinforcement learning model designed specifically for solving PVRPs. Key features:

- **Profile-Aware Encoding**: Uses attention mechanisms to create unique representations for each vehicle-client combination based on their profiles;
- **Multi-Agent Communication**: Enables vehicles to share information and make cooperative decisions;
- **Parallel Decision Making**: Each vehicle independently evaluates and selects its next actions while considering other vehicles' states;
- **Attention-Based Pointer**: Efficiently selects the next client for each vehicle based on their profile-specific embeddings.

The model learns to balance individual vehicle constraints with overall fleet efficiency through reinforcement learning, making it adaptable to different PVRP variants. We show the overall illustration of the CAMP model as following:

### *Q. How good it is?*

Here are some performance highlights of CAMP:

- Competitive solution quality compared to traditional algorithms;
- Faster computation time than classical methods;
- Strong performance against other neural network approaches:
    - ET: [Equity-Transformer: Solving NP-Hard Min-Max Routing Problems as Sequential Generation with Equity Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02689);
    - DPN: [DPN: Decoupling Partition and Navigation for Neural Solvers of Min-max Vehicle Routing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17272);
    - 2D-Ptr: [2D-Ptr: 2D Array Pointer Network for Solving the Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3635637.3662981);
    - PARCO: [PARCO: Learning Parallel Autoregressive Policies for Efficient Multi-Agent Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03811);
- Suitable for real-time routing applications.

The results demonstrate CAMP's effectiveness as a practical solution for complex vehicle routing problems in production environments. We show the Pareto front of the cost of VRP-P against different preference weight for different preference matrix distribution as following. The left
bottom is better.
